# gigVoice

The aim of this application is to aid 2GIG Gen 1 Alarm panel installers in finding zone codes required for programming the alarm panel.

Though straightforward yet effective, this version enables security installers to search for voice codes for Gen2 2gig panels. 
Enter a word like "home" or "front" into the search box and click Go! If there's a match, the equivalent 2gig voice code will be shown. 
Otherwise, the program will display "No entries found".

In the future, updates to the program will provide installers with the capability to view voice codes in alphabetical order.
